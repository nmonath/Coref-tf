## Overview 


## Experimental Results 

| Model          | F1 (%) |
| -------------- |:------:|
| CorefQA + SpanBERT-base  | 79.9  |
| CorefQA + SpanBERT-large | 83.1   |



## Data Preprocess 
1. Download the [Ontonotes 5.0](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) dataset.
2. Split train/dev/test datasets and preprocess the official release `ontonotes-release-5.0` for coreference resolution annotations. <br>
Run `./scripts/preprocess_conll_data.sh  <PATH-TO-ontonotes-release-5.0> <PATH-TO-SAVE-CoNLL-FORMAT-DATASETS> <PATH-TO-CorefQA-REPOSITORY>`. <br>
E.g.: `./scripts/preprocess_conll_data.sh /home/shannon/ontonotes-release-5.0 /home/shannnon/conll12_coreference_data /home/shannon/CorefQA`
3. Generate and save training datasets to TFRecord files. <br>
Run `./scripts/generate_train_data.sh <PATH-TO-SAVE-CoNLL-FORMAT-DATASETS> <LANGUAGE> <NUMBER-of-SLIDING-WINDOW-SIZE>`<br>
E.g.: `./scripts/generate_train_data.sh /home/shannon/conll12_coreference_data english 384`


## Replicate Experimental Results 

### Install Package Dependencies 

* Install packages dependencies via : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* TPU <br> 
  - Cloud TPU v3-8 device with Tensorflow 1.15 Python 3.5. 

### Train CorefQA Model

1. Download Data Augmentation Models <br>
Run `./scripts/download_qauad2_finetune_model.sh <model-scale> <path-to-save-model>` to download finetuned SpanBERT on SQuAD2.0. <br>
The `<model-scale>` should take the value of `[base, large]`. <br>
The `<path-to-save-model>` is the path to save finetuned spanbert on SQuAD2.0 datasets. <br>
2. Train CoNLL-12 Coreference Resolution Model. <br> 
If using TPU, please run `./scripts/tpu/train_tpu.sh`<br>
If using GPU, please run `./scripts/gpu/train_spanbert.sh`. 

### Prediction

* Save the text for prediction in a txt file. If the text contains speaker name information, wrap the speaker with `<speaker></speaker>` and put it in front of its utterence. For example:
```text
<speaker> Host </speaker> A traveling reporter now on leave and joins us to tell her story. Thank you for coming in to share this with us.
```
* run `python3 ./run/evaluate.py <experiment> <input_file> <output_file>` will save the prediction results in `<output_file>`, The prediction for each instance is a list of clustersï¼Œeach cluster is a list of mentions. Each mention is (text, (span_start, span_end)). For example:
```python
[[('A traveling reporter', (26, 46)), ('her', (81, 84)), ('you', (98, 101))]]
```
